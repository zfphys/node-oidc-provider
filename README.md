## Support

If you or your business use oidc-provider, or you need help using/upgrading the module, please consider becoming a [sponsor][support-sponsor] so I can continue maintaining it and adding new features carefree. The only way to guarantee you get feedback from the author & sole maintainer of this module is to support the package through GitHub Sponsors. I make it a best effort to try and answer newcomers regardless of being a supporter or not, but if you're asking your n-th question and don't get an answer it's because I'm out of handouts and spare time to give.

## Get started
You may check the [example folder](/example) or follow a [step by step example][example-repo] to see
which of those fits your desired application setup.

An example configuration of oidc-provider is available for you to experiment with
[here][heroku-example]. Dynamic Client Registration is open, you can literally register any client
you want there. An example client using this provider is available [here][heroku-example-client]
(uses [openid-client][openid-client]).

Also be sure to check the available configuration docs section.

## [Documentation](/docs/README.md) & Configuration

oidc-provider can be mounted to existing connect, express, fastify, hapi, or koa applications, see
[how](/docs/README.md#mounting-oidc-provider). The provider allows to be extended and configured in
various ways to fit a variety of uses. See the [documentation](/docs/README.md).

```js
const { Provider } = require('oidc-provider');
const configuration = {
  // ... see available options /docs
  clients: [{
    client_id: 'foo',
    client_secret: 'bar',
    redirect_uris: ['http://lvh.me:8080/cb'],
    // + other client properties
  }],
};

const oidc = new Provider('http://localhost:3000', configuration);

// express/nodejs style application callback (req, res, next) for use with express apps, see /examples/express.js
oidc.callback()

// koa application for use with koa apps, see /examples/koa.js
oidc.app

// or just expose a server standalone, see /examples/standalone.js
const server = oidc.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('oidc-provider listening on port 3000, check http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration');
});
```


## Recipes
Collection of useful configurations use cases are available over at [recipes](/recipes).


## Events
Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, using event handlers you can hook into the various
actions and i.e. emit metrics or that react to specific triggers. In some scenarios you can even
change the defined behavior.  
See the list of available emitted [event names](/docs/events.md) and their description.
