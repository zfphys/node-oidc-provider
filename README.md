# oidc-provider

oidc-provider is an OpenID Provider implementation of [OpenID Connect][openid-connect]. It allows to
export a complete mountable or standalone OpenID Provider implementation. This implementation does
not force you into any data models or persistance stores, instead it expects you to provide an
adapter. A generic in memory adapter is available to get you started.

The provided examples also implement simple user interaction views but those are not forced on you
as they do not come as part of the exported application, instead you are encouraged to implement
your own unique-looking and functioning user flows.

## Certification
[<img width="184" height="96" align="right" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/acd3ebf2/OpenID_Certified.png" alt="OpenID Certification">][openid-certified-link]  
Filip Skokan has [certified][openid-certified-link] that [oidc-provider][npm-url]
conforms to the OP Basic, OP Implicit, OP Hybrid, OP Config and OP Dynamic profiles
of the OpenID Connectâ„¢ protocol.


## Get started
You may follow an example [step by step setup][example-repo] (recommended), or run and experiment with an
example server that's part of the repo (if you can follow the structure, if not check the step by step).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider.git oidc-provider
$ cd oidc-provider
$ npm install
$ node example
```
Visiting `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration` will help you to discover how the
example is [configured](/example).

This example is also deployed and available for you to experiment with [here][heroku-example].
An example client using this provider is available [here][heroku-example-client]
(uses [openid-client][openid-client]).

Otherwise just install the package in your app and follow the [example use](/example/index.js).
It is easy to use with [express](/example/express.js) too.
```
$ npm install oidc-provider --save
```


### 1.0.0 Notice
Migrating from 0.11.x release? Quite a bit has changed along the way to end up with a stable and
sustainable API, see the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md#version-100) for list of changes and how to
change your existing 0.11 providers to 1.0


## Configuration and Initialization
oidc-provider allows to be extended and configured in various ways to fit a variety of uses. See
the [available configuration](/docs/configuration.md).

```js
const Provider = require('oidc-provider');
const issuer = 'http://localhost:3000';
const configuration = {
  // ... see available options /docs/configuration.md
};
const clients = [  ];

const oidc = new Provider(issuer, configuration);
oidc.initialize({ clients }).then(function () {
  console.log(oidc.callback); // => express/nodejs style application callback (req, res)
  console.log(oidc.app); // => koa1.x application
});
```


## Debugging
oidc-provider uses the [debug][debug-link] module internally to log information about various states
of authentication requests, errors and grants. To see all these set the DEBUG environment variable
to oidc-provider:* when launching your app.

There is no filter on what is included in the debug output, since it may end-user Personally
identifiable information or client credentials it's use is only advised for debugging, not regular
logging. Use emitted events to cherry pick the one's of interest to your flows and form your own
logs aware of what should and should not be a part of a logged message.


## Events
Your oidc-provider instance is an event emitter, using event handlers you can hook into the various
actions and i.e. emit metrics or that react to specific triggers. In some scenarios you can even
change the defined behavior.  
See the list of available emitted [event names](/docs/events.md) and their description.
