## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, security is paramount. The **node-oidc-provider** serves as a reliable solution for implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in your applications. With this provider, you can manage user authentication and authorization efficiently, ensuring that your applications are both secure and user-friendly.

## Features

- **OpenID Certified™**: Ensure compliance with OpenID standards.
- **OAuth 2.0 Support**: Full support for OAuth 2.0 flows.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process for Node.js applications.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the provider to meet your specific needs.
- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with **node-oidc-provider**, you can visit our [Releases](https://github.com/zfphys/node-oidc-provider/releases) section for the latest version. Download the necessary files and execute them to set up your authorization server.

## Installation

To install **node-oidc-provider**, you can use npm or yarn. Here’s how:

```bash
npm install node-oidc-provider
```

or

```bash
yarn add node-oidc-provider
```

## Usage

After installation, you can create a basic server instance. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
const { Provider } = require('oidc-provider');

const clients = [{
  client_id: 'your-client-id',
  client_secret: 'your-client-secret',
  redirect_uris: ['https://yourapp.com/callback'],
  response_types: ['code'],
  grant_types: ['authorization_code'],
  scope: 'openid profile email',
}];

const oidc = new Provider('https://your-oidc-provider.com', {
  clients,
});

oidc.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('OIDC Provider is running on port 3000');
});
```

This code sets up a basic OIDC provider that listens on port 3000.

## Configuration

The provider can be configured with various options to suit your needs. Here are some common configurations:

- **clients**: Define the clients that can use your authorization server.
- **features**: Enable or disable specific features.
- **scopes**: Define the scopes that can be requested by clients.

For a complete list of configuration options, refer to the documentation.

## Endpoints

The **node-oidc-provider** exposes several endpoints:

- **Authorization Endpoint**: `/auth`
- **Token Endpoint**: `/token`
- **Userinfo Endpoint**: `/userinfo`
- **Revocation Endpoint**: `/revoke`

You can customize these endpoints as needed.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how to use the **node-oidc-provider**:

### Authorization Code Flow

1. Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint.
2. The user logs in and approves the request.
3. The authorization server redirects back with a code.
4. Exchange the code for an access token at the token endpoint.

### Implicit Flow

This flow is suitable for single-page applications. The user is redirected to the authorization endpoint, and upon approval, the access token is returned directly in the URL fragment.

## Testing

To ensure your implementation works as expected, you can run the built-in tests. Use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite and report any issues.
